# Testing Implementation Log

## Migration from Vitest to Jest
- Installed Jest and related dependencies
- Configured Jest with jest.config.js and babel.config.js
- Updated package.json scripts for running tests

## API Service Tests
- Implemented tests for fetchPlaceDetails function
- Implemented tests for fetchPlacePhotos function
- Implemented tests for searchPlaces function
- Added error handling tests

## Component Tests
### PlaceDetails Component
- Tested rendering of place information (name, address, rating)
- Tested photo loading functionality
- Tested handling of missing data (no photos, no types, no opening hours)
- Tested error handling for photo loading

### PlaceSearch Component
- Tested form rendering and default values
- Tested search submission and API integration
- Tested form validation for empty queries
- Tested location input changes
- Tested API error handling
- Tested loading state during search

## Utility Function Tests
- Tested date formatting functions
- Tested currency formatting functions
- Tested address formatting functions
- Tested rating formatting functions
- Tested text truncation functions

## Testing Techniques Implemented
- Mocking external dependencies (fetch API, API service functions)
- Testing asynchronous operations with async/await, waitFor, and act
- Component testing for both rendering and interaction
- Error state testing
- Form validation testing
- Loading state testing

## Best Practices Implemented
- Test data isolation with mock data
- Mock reset between tests to prevent test pollution
- Accessibility-focused testing with role-based queries
- Comprehensive test coverage for happy paths and error cases
- Clear arrange-act-assert pattern in tests

## Test Results
- All 8 test suites passing
- Total of 37 tests passing
- Tests covering API services, UI components, and utility functions
